Ah, lately the old memories seem to be flooding back.<br1>
Long ago, you know, this wharf was beehive of activity!<br1>
Trade ships of the Kresnik dropped anchor every day,<br1>
filled to the gunwales with all sorts of wonderful items.<br1>
Giran to the south -- even Heine -- were nothing by<br1>
comparison.<br>
But then the war came, and diplomatic relations with the<br1>
Kresnik were cut off. No longer did the wealth-laden trade<br1>
ships visit. Today, all we see are small passenger ships.<br1>
Oh, once in a long while, a foreign vessel carrying a party<br1>
of adventurers may stop in, but...<br>
Sigh...<br>
Oh, before I forget: I have heard news that a ferry has<br1>
begun service to Gludin Harbor, which is in the Gludio<br1>
region of Aden Kingdom. The delays of the initial trial runs<br1>
are over, and it is now in full operation. Why don't you<br1>
take a trip?<br>
