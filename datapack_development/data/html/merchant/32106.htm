I don't know if you know this, but this wharf was once so<br1>
ridiculously shabby it couldn't even be properly called a<br1>
wharf! Compared to then, it's a heck of a lot better now.<br>
I still get a child down my back thinking about those days...<br>
From time to time, those horrifying dinosaurs would even<br1>
charge down from the jungle to devour the settlers. Now<br1>
you see me as an old wharf manager, but back then I was<br1>
just a hot-blooded young adventurer like you spoiling for<br1>
a fight! Some days I was ready to tear into them with my<br1>
bare hands. Of course, then I saw what they could de to<br1>
the unskilled... Ah, but I still miss the days of my youth<br>
