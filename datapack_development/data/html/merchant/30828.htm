Pet Manager Waters:
<br>
We've got a special food that wolves absolutely love. If you feed this to your wolf, it will tear even a turek warhound to shreds! We also have Steel teeth made by Dwarven hooligans! And hatchling products! Feel free to look around! Good owners always come to this Pet Kennel of the Town of Dion!
