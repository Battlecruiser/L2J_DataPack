<br>
Come on in sir.  Welcome to Aden castle town.  Among all the towns on the continent, this town is the biggest and most affluent.  As you must have already seen, this town is surrounded by a huge external castle wall and supported by pillars to stand high into the air.  Don t you think that the appearance of this town is suitable for a capital of a kingdom that rules over a continent?
