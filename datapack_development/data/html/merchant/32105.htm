Are you looking for anything in particular? Oh, please<br1>
don't be fooled just because I'm a merchant at a small<b1>
wharf; I have a wide selection for you to choose from. If<br1>
you see anything you can't live without, just say the<br1>
word!<br>
What, nothing that makes your eyes widen with longing?<br1>
Believe me, I can offer everything you'll find on the<br1>
mainland. Why don't you test me for yourself?<br>
