<tr><td>Tetrarch Thifiell:</td></tr>
<br>
<tr><td>The Holy War of Darkness continues even now,</td></tr>
<tr><td>to punish the Humans who deceived and</td></tr>
<tr><td>betrayed us, and the Elves of light, who</td></tr>
<tr><td>persecuted and oppressed us. Our revenge is</td></tr>
<tr><td>not over yet. Living a long time in the dark, we</td></tr>
<tr><td>relize the truths hidden in shadows more</td></tr>
<tr><td>readily than anyone else. Based on teh true</td></tr>
<tr><td>power of darkness, there will come a day when</td></tr>
<tr><td>we conquer the continent. This is the fate and</td></tr>
<tr><td>future of all Dark Elves.</td></tr>
<br>
<tr><td>Preparing for the final holy war, our brothers</td></tr>
<tr><td>are going out into the Human world this very</td></tr>
<tr><td>moment and quietly, but certainly, are gathering</td></tr>
<tr><td>their strength and expanding their powers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>There is no future for those who fear to leave</td></tr>
<tr><td>the forest. Bear in mind that only those who go</td></tr>
<tr><td>out into the outside world without fear will</td></tr>
<tr><td>receive the opportunities to obtain new</td></tr>
<tr><td>powers.</td></tr>
