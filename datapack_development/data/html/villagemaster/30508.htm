High Prefect Castor:
<br>
I am the High Prefect Castor, heir to the authority of the eternal father of fire, Paagrio, and one who endeavors to revive the glory of the Orcs by teaching them. Young Orc warrior, you are the flame of hope that can revive the fallen glory of the Orc race once more. Well then, how can I help you?
