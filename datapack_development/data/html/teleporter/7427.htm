<tr><td>These ruins were used in the past by the elves
as a laboratory to research maigc. These
days, very dangerous monsters lurk nearby,
and so Sir Collin Windawood has sealed the
entrance and forbidden the common folk from
coming here. However, we may teleport
adventures seeking training to just inside of
the entrance. Would you like to go inside the
ruins?</tr></td>
