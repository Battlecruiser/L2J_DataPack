Blacksmith Feynn:<br>
Welcome! Come in. Let me guess... you want me to build something for you! Well now, isn't it great to be so in demand? Ahh... but it can be a nuisance to be famous as well. Basically, I'm a jack of all trades and can make just about anything. However, I can't squander my talents on just anyone...<br>
I guess what I'm trying to say is... I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine... Understand? Nothing comes free in this world, right? What do you have to offer?<br>
