Blacksmith Morning : 
<br><br>
Ah, so you wish to enhance your weapon, eh? Well, if you can't afford to buy a better weapon, then it*s not a bad idea. Actually, a higher price doesn't necessarily mean a better product. There are many excellent weapons that are reasonably priced.
<br>
Don't worry, adding capabilities to your weapon doesn't interfere with enchant, but once you add a capability it cannot be removed.
<br>
You can see the weapons you own below.
<br>
Could it be that I'm telling you something you already know?
<br>
Choose the weapons enhancement you wish to apply!
