Hello! Isn't it a beautiful day?
<br>
would you like to have a symbol made?
<br>
Have you brought dye?
<br>
Symbols are not easly made!
<br>
You must be certain of what you want before we begin! This is an expensive project and you cannot afford any false starts!
<br>
Although expensive, if you choose well, your symbol will be a good investment for you, as valuable as an excellent sword or shield!
