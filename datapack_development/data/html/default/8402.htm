<html><body>I am a trader on business sent by the Lord.<br>


I have been dispatched to sell seed and to purchase products that are indigenous to this manor. The sale and purchasing of seed starts from 8 p.m. everyday... If you could not buy any seed today, come back tomorrow after 8 p.m. I will then have a whole new batch of seed again. Every day from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m., you will be able to look up information regarding the next status of the manor! So, don't forget!

<br>
If you have any such indigenous products, I will buy them from you now. The Lord will be pleased. Don't be embarrassed if you don't know the meanings of some of the words I use, such as "manor" or "indigenous product". All questions will be answered, you need only ask.<br>
