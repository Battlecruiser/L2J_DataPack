Ah, so you wish to enhance your weapon! Well, it's the next-best thing to buying a new one, I say...But remember, a higher price doesn't necessarily mean a better product. There are many excellent weapons that are reasonably priced.
<br>
As I'm sure you know, capabilities added to your weapon will not interfere with enchantments.
<br>
Oh, I must tell you, I can't handle A grade weapons. For those you'll need to find the legendary Blacksmith of Mammon, a giant among blacksmiths! He may be able to do it.
<br>
Also...when you want to remove special capabilities from your weapon, the Trade of Mammon can help you...By the way, I heard a rumor that the Black Marketeer of Mammon has learned the technique of removing special capabilites from weapons from the Trade of Mammon.
<br>
I'll bet you already knew that, too, didn't you?
<br>
Choose the capabilities you wish to add to your weapons!
