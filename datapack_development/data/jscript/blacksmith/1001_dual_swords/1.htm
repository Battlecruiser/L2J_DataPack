Naturallly, in order to create a dual sword, you'll need the two swords that are to be combined.
<br>
And of course, I don't work for free...
<br>
As you probably know, dual swords must be perfectly balanced.
<br>
Only swords of identical grade may be combined.
<br>
I am only able to work on weapons up to C grade. If you wish to combine weapons of a higher grade, you'll need to take them to the Town of Aden...
<br>
Remember, enchanted weapons use their magic once they are combined with another sword.
<br>
Ah yes, one more thing... Weapons that have had a skill added may not be combined.
<br>
You probably already knew all of this...
<br>
Select the swords that you wish to combine from the list...
