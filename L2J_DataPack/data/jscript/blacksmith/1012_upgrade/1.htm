Blacksmith of Mammon:<br><br>
I'll make a weapon upgrade for you. For example, I will exchange a Dark Elven Dagger for an
Stiletto. However, there are a couple of things you should know.<br>
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Special Abilities</font> don't transfer
<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Enchantments</font> don't transfer with exchange
