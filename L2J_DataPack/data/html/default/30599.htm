<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
Greetings! It is my task to educate novice Elves.<br> 
Elven lives are long by the standards of other folk, so the choices an Elf makes in youth will bear fruit for many years to come. I teach the novices until it is time for them to leave this their home. If you require advice, please feel welcome to ask me.<br>
