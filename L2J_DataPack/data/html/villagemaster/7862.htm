Grand Master Oltlin:
<br>
You've really come a long way from your village. Young child of Shilen... Looking at the great fortress and prosperous roads of which the Humans boast, I wonder what enjoyment that is? I'm warning you. Regardless of the enjoyment and praise, don't become overly engrossed in it. You'll find a snake hole at the base of a beautiful flower. Soon you'll come up against the hidden face of this city...
