Blacksmith of Mammon:
<br>
Ah, yes, the seal of gnosis! May you recive the blessings of Mammon! You have come a long way to find me. I can provide you with the highest-quality weapons and armor.
<br>
Blacksmiths the world over try to copy my refined techniques, but their work pales in comparison to mine.
<br>
I must ask you but one thing. As a dwarf of Mammon, I cannot accept money from the outside world. I can only accept payment in <font color="LEVEL">ancient adena</font>.
