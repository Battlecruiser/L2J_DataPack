Do you know how to fish?
If you want to learn, I can teach you.
There's nothing as fun and relaxing as fishing.
Highly-stressed people like you need some time alone, or perhaps to be with a few friends in a quiet place like this.<br>
Oh, by the way, if you catch more fish than you can handle, bring them to me!<br>
