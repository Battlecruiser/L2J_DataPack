Fishermen's Guild Member Linneus:<br>
Did you know? Our king also likes fishing very much. It is the pride of us Fishermen's guild members. The king possesses superb fishing skills to boot!<br>
Oh, I am Linneus, Fishermen's Guild member. Aden has many great places to fish. When we have beautiful weather, why don't you take some time off and go enjoy some fishing? Won't it give you the air of an aristocrat? Ha Ha Ha Ha!<br>
