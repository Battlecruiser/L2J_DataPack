Blacksmith Morning : 
<br><br>
It is only natural that in order to create a dual sword, you'd need the two swords which are being combined.
<br>
Of course, I change a small fee since I'm not working for charity and all. And heating costs for stoking the fire are pretty steep...
<br>
As you may know, it is not easy to handle the sword unless the balance between both hands is equal.
<br>
That means that only swords of identical grades can be combined...
<br>
Plus, keep in mind that enchanted weapons lose their effect once they are combined with another sword.
<br>
One more thing. If you have added another skill to a weapon, you cannot use the weapon to be combined with another weapon to create a dual sword, It just won*t work. They cannot be combined.
<br>
My, am I worrying for nothing? Well, I'm sure you know all of this.
<br>
Here, select the sword that you wish to combine from the following list!
