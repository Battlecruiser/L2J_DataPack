 <font color="LEVEL">New Character Bonus</font><br>
 The first character on each server to reach <font color="LEVEL">level 6</font> is called a "new character". Before a character reaches level 6, another character can be created on the same server and developed into a new character. A new character receives various benefits up to level 25. <br>
 The benefits given to a new character are as follows:<br>
 <font color="LEVEL">Exchange Equipment</font><br>
Equipment can be exchanged in weapon, armor and accessory shops by paying the difference in price. All no-grade equipment can be exchanged in this way. <br>
