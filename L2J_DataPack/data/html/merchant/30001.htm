		May I give you a piece of advice? The most expensive<br1>
		equipment is not always the best. Do you think that a<br1>
		child could defend himself with a two-handed sword if he<br1>
		had one? Equipment only serves its purpose when it is<br1>
		suited to one's profession and condition. Now, choose<br1>
		what you need.<br>
