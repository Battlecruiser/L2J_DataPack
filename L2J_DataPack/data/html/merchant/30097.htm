To be a legendary warrior, you need a one-of-a-kind weapon, the sort of thing bards will sing about for generations!<br>
We can provide you that, but I'm sorry to say that we cannot accept Adena as payment. We only accept <font color="LEVEL">crystals</font>.<br>
If you require new armor or other rare items, please speak with my wife.<br>
