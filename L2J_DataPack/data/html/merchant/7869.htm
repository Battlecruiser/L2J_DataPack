Hmm... There's a somewhat dubious rumor doing the rounds... There seems to be someone that is collecting drake and wyrm eggs in an organized manner. Hatchlings are just pets but that changes completely if they are changed to striders. I can think of one thing... Somebody that is forming an army of striders...!
