Lately,I just can't keep thinking back to the good old days... At one time, there were Grecian trading ships anchored here every day! Aye, we even surpassed Giran and Heine!<br>
Alas, the bloody war put an end to that! These days, only small ferries show up here, with the occasional odd ocean-going ship carrying adeventures...<br>
Come to think of it, the ferry to Gludin Harbor in the Kingdom of Aden began to run recently! I've heard that it's even got a regular schedule! You should give it a try!<br>
