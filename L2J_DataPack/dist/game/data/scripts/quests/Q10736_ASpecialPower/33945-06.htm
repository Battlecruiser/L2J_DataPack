<html><body>Master Katalin:<br>
Do you know what just happened? You were able to use a lot of abilities when you were in the Wind Spirit Realm. But as you came through the Dimensional Rift, your abilities were locked.<br>
But you just unlocked one of those abilities. They call them <font color="LEVEL">Skills</font> here.<br>
As you train more, you will be able to get more skills back.<br>
Shall we fight a more powerfull enemy with your new skill?<br>
