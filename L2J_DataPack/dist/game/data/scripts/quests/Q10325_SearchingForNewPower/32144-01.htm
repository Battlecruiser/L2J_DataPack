<html><body>Master Xonia:<br>
Welcome, Kamael.<br>I am Xonia. I wish to teach you about the classes available to our kind.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Kamael Soldiers</font> are powerful with both spell and sword, and attack with great speed. They use their opponents' souls to unleash their most powerful skills!<br>
As your strength grows, you'll notice a <font color="LEVEL">Skill Window automatically popping up</font> from time to time. You can also use the shortcut key <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font> to check out the list of skills you already know of.
