<html><body>Master Black:<br>
Welcome! My name is Black and I am a skillmaster to the Dark Elves.<br>
I want to take a minute to tell you about the different classes I train.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dark Fighters</font> fight extremely quickly thanks to their high Atk and Evasion rates.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Dark Mages</font> have powerful M. Atk. and high Healing abilities.<br>
As you gain new levels and stronger skills become available a <font color="LEVEL">Skill Window icon will automatically appear</font>. Click it to open your Skills Window. Furthermore, you can open your Skills Window by pressing <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font>, to see your Active, Passive, and Skills you can learn.
