<html><body>Prefect Herz:<br>
Welcome, warrior of flame. I am Herz, the Orc race trainer. Listen up! I'll explain the characteristics and skills of Orc race classes to you.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Orc Fighters</font> have fast and good physical and Mana healings, making long battles possible.<br>Even though an <font color="LEVEL">Orc Mystic</font> uses magic, the class also has warrior abilities. We are Orcs, after all.<br>
When your abilities improve, and you have new skills that you can learn, the <font color="LEVEL">Skill Window will automatically</font> appear. You can check the list of skills that you have by using the shortcut keys <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font>.
