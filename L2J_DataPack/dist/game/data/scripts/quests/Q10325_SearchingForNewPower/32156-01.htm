<html><body>Master Talbot:<br>
Welcome!<br>
I am Talbot, human skillmaster, here to explain the benefits and drawbacks of the classes we can choose from.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Human Fighters</font> mainly employ short-range melee attacks, and can handle most basic weapons and armor types.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Human Mages</font> have an innate affinity for the power of the spoken word. They use Elemental Magic, White Magic, Supplemental Magic, Dark Magic and Summon Magic!<br>
As your strength grows, you'll notice a <font color="LEVEL">Skill Window automatically show up</font> from time to time. You can also use the shortcut key <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font> to check out the skills you already know.
