<html><body>Master Cidnet:<br>
Welcome! I am Cidnet, skillmaster to the Elves!<br>
If you have a moment, I would like to tell you a little about some of the classes available to us Elves.<br><font color="LEVEL">Elven Fighters</font> have high Evasion Rate, Attack Accuracy, and are skilled with bows.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Elven Mages</font> can cast ferociously quickly, and recover lost mana at quite a rate!<br>
If your powers improve and gain access to stronger skills, a <font color="LEVEL">Skill Window will automatically pop up</font>. Furthermore, you can use the shortcut key <font color="LEVEL">ALT+K</font>, to check out the list of skills you've learned.
