I like your spirit, kid.<br>
I will be sure to keep an eye on your progress… there are still other pieces of the Giant to be found and I’m sure our paths will cross again.<br>
But, before you leave, I have one more thing I wish to give you. Call it a little bonus for all the work you have done.<br>
I would like to provide you with a Soul Crystal to enhance your weapon.<br>
