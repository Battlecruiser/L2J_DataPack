Hmm? A note? Let's see.<br>
To Evna.<br1>
I wrote a poem about you.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The soft cooling breeze<br1>
reminds me of you.<br1>
The breeze heartlessly passes by.<br1>
When will you stay with me?</font><br>
Eww! What is this?<br1>
Hey! If you want business with me, then you'd better stop running his creepy errands.<br>
Almost had a heart attack there. I'm into someone beautiful and powerful. Like Venir. Got it?
