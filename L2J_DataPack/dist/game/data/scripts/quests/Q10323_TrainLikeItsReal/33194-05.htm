You don't? Then why don't you try again with these soulshot I have for you? 
Open your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory</font>, check for <font color=LEVEL>Soulshots or Spiritshots</font>.<br>
Click and Drag</font> Soulshot/Spiritshot into your Shortcut Bar. Right Click the Soulshot/Spiritshot Shortcut Icon to use it automatically.
After this, the lights of the spirits will help you every time you attack.<br>
Tell me when you have that done.
