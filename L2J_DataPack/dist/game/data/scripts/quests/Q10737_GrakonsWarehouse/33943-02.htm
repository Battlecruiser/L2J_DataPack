The people who can send you across space to a different territory -- Gatekeepers, Adventurer's Guidess Auction Hourse Mangers, Mentor Guides, Warehouse Keepers -- are truly  beyond counting.<br>
But of these, I find <font color="LEVEL"> Warehouse Manager Grakon</font> to be most helpful I am in the habit of using the warehouse since I am weighed down by many heavy tags when I travel about. Even now I'm overburdened!<br>
And so, a favor! I cannot abandon my position here, so I cannot deposit my bags. Would you be so king as to deposit them for me? As a reward, I will give you something useful for when you leave town.<br>
