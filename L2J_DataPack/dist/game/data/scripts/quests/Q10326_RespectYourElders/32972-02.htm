Suspicious Types... Now I remember that in recent times have also seen in the Museum of strange personalities. It seemed to me that they are looking for material on the Giants... Maybe they're one of those bands that were seen in the Ruins?<br><br>
They tried to steal a book called <font color="LEVEL">War of the Gods and the Giants </ font>. In this ancient manuscript contains information in the power of the Giants, the origin of their powers, monsters era Giants and the like. I am afraid that now, after the fall of the Island of Giants, this information can be used for evil purposes. It is necessary to rearrange the book elsewhere.
