Ah, you have excellent taste! This bracelet is truly unique. In fact, it is said that it contains an <font color="LEVEL">Agathion</font>. Quite a find, eh? Wondering if it is for sale? Of course it is -- that's why I'm here!<br>
Both this <font color="LEVEL">Little Angel Agathion Bracelet</font> and this <font color="LEVEL">Little Devil Agathion Bracelet</font> were discovered by another group of adventurers while exploring some ancient ruins. I am positive that they contain Agathions! Of course, no one knows for sure the power an Agathion possesses or how long it lasts. I have been reluctant to experiment on them because it's clear that some of the bracelets possess only limited magic power.<br>
Others have more, however. What you get depends on your luck, I'm afraid.<br>
To get either the angel or devil bracelet, you must bring me <font color="LEVEL">10 Fish Bones</font>, <font color="LEVEL">10 Fish Scales</font>, <font color="LEVEL">10 units of Fish Oil</font>, <font color="LEVEL">10 Fish Fins</font>, <font color="LEVEL">10 Fish Gems</font>, <font color="LEVEL">5 units of Whale Blubber</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">3,000,000 Adena</font>. I wish I could part with them in exchange for crystals as I normally would, but the adventurers who delivered the bracelets here insisted on these other items for payment.<br>
Even so, I still believe this is a reasonable price. After all, an Agathion isn't something you run across every day, eh? So, would you like to buy one?<br>
