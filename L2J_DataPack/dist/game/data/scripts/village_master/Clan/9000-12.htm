<html><body> Clans Lv. 5 or above can found an Academy.<br>
You can enroll in an Academy if your main and subclasses are all below Lv. 85 and have not Awakened. If an Academy member Awakens, they automatically graduate.<br>
Up to 20 members may enroll at an Academy. The amount of Reputation a clan receives when a member graduates varies depending on the member's level upon entry.<br>
When a clan founds an Academy, its clan leader gains buffs for the benefit of the members.<br>
Academy members can use their Academy Circlets to efficiently power-up their character.<br>
The leader can appoint a clan member to sponsor an Academy member, which gives the sponsor buffs to use on the sponsored member. They're a bit weaker than the clan leader's buffs, however.<br>
In addition, sponsors can help their partners carry out Academy quests, and check their login status.<br>
Academy members can do Academy quests with their sponsors at Lv. 70. Upon success, the clan, sponsor, and Academy member are all rewarded.<br>
