<html><body>Blacksmith Wilbert:<br>
What do we do here? Well, blacksmiths make things like armor, swords, polearms, axes, plows... But wait! There's more! Look, over there... Aden Castle stands, proudly disregarding the laws of gravity. And you know why? Engineering! It would have collapsed a long time ago if it hadn't been for the efforts of the Black Anvil craftsmen.<br>
And... This is just a rumor, but... They say that the giant golem the rebels used to evict the Human lords was made and sold by the Black Anvil. After all, who else could do something like that, right?<br>
