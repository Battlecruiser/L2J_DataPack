Just because you want to learn doesn't mean I can teach you. My Dwarven brethren would frown on me teaching these valuable skills to an outsider. Besides, you don't even have the basic knowledge necessary as a foundation. If you were a Dwarven Warsmith or Artisan, then perhaps I could do something for you!
