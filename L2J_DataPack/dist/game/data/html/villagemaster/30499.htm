<html><body>Head Blacksmith Tapoy:<br>
I'm Head Blacksmith Tapoy of the Black Anvil Guild located here in Gludin territory. I'm sure that you already know of our reputation for producing highly skilled Artisans and Warsmiths. As we say back home, a Dwarven tribe without our guild is like a "a bee without honey" or an "Elf without his pride." Ha ha! So, what has brought you here?<br>
