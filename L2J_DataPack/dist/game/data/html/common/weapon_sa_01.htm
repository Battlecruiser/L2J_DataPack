So you want to enhance your weapon, huh? Not a bad idea. Really, expensive weapons aren't necessarily the best, you know? It all depends on how well it suits ya.<br>
And no need to worry about enchants disappearing! Oh, they'll stay all right.<br>
Check out the item info for their new abilities. And don't forget, you'll only see the weapons you have!<br>
By the way, if you have A-grade or above...I can't help ya. It's just beyond us, you know? Maybe the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font> might be able to do something about it.<br>
Oh, and the <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font> will be able to help you <font color="LEVEL">remove</font> powers from your weapon too. Rumors say the <font color="LEVEL">Black Marketeer of Mammon</font> learned how to do that from the blacksmith, so there's that too.<br>
Well, enough talking. Pick the weapon you want to enhance!<br>
Choose the capabilities you wish to add to your weapons!<br>
