		SQL File History, or, "What happened to the files?"

The npc.sql and npcskills.sql files from the experimental folder became obsolete as of C4 :)
so basically were deleted. You can still find them in the C3 branch if you really want to. 
But we would highly reccomend you don't do that.

	Notes:
	(by no means extensive final or accurate but better than nothing, other devs feel free to add comments - warrax)

		NPC
/sql/npc.sql    -> better stats
/sql/experimental/npc.sql    -> DELETED

		NPCSKILLS
/sql/npcskills.sql    -> better skills
/sql/experimental/npcskills.sql    -> DELETED

		SPAWNLIST
/sql/spawnlist.sql    -> only active spawnlist
/sql/experimental/spawnlist-experimental.sql    -> some entries still need to be merged on active spawnlist, but no C4 spawns here
/sql/experimental/spawnlist-loc_id.sql   -> DELETED LONG TIME AGO

In short, don't use experimental spawnlist.
