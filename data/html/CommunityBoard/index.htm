Welcome to your new community board  !<br>
<br>
Admin, you can customize this file by editing the file index.htm, in directory 
'data/html/ComunityBoard' of your DataPack.<br><br><br>
You can also make links like : <a action="bypass _bbstop;1">My link</a><br>
The link must be bypass _bbstop;X with X a integer like bypass _bbstop;1<br>
The link bypass _bbstop;1 shows the file 1.htm of your 'data/html/ComunityBoard',
bypass _bbstop;2 the file 2.html etc...<br><br>
<br>
Community Board can support html 3 times longer than a classical npc dialog html !
<br>
<br>
<br><br><br>
Be Careful : client crashes if the html is not valid for it !
